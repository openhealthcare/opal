Opal is a full stack web framework that makes building digital tools for health care easy.

It builds on established open source technologies with a track record of helping developers
build easy to maintain, robust applications.

Most notably, it makes use of [Django](https://djangoproject.com/), [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/)
and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/).

From there, Opal provides you with a common batteries-included architecture for writing healthcare
applications, and a composable modular framework that takes advantage of generic, re-usable components.

Opal is entirely open ([source](https://github.com/openhealthcare/opal) &
[Governance](https://github.com/openhealthcare/opal/issues)) as are the wide library of plugins.

Opal was created by [Open Health Care UK](http://openhealthcare.org.uk), because it makes Healthcare IT Less Bad.

We'd love you to get involved by using what we make, reporting bugs/suggesting improvements, and fixing bugs/updating documentation/making improvements.
