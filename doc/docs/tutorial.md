## Writing a clinical service with Opal

This tutorial will walk you through the creation of a new Opal service.

The application we're going to be building will help clinical users to manage the patients on a ward in a hospital.

So that I can treat them effectively and safely.

### Bootstrapping a new project

We assume that you've already [Installed Opal](installation.md). You can tell which version of opal is installed
by running this command

    $ opal --version

At the start a new project, Opal will bootstrap the initial project structure, including
a Django project, some core datamodels (complete with JSON APIs) and a general application structure.

From the commandline:

    $ opal startproject mynewapp

This will create a mynewapp directory where your new project lives.

Let's have a look at what that created for you:


    mynewapp/                   # Your project directory
        LICENSE                 # A dummy LICENSE file
        Procfile                # A procfile ready for deployment to e.g. Heroku
        README.md
        manage.py               # Django's manage.py script
        requirements.txt        # Requirements file ready for your project

        data/                   # A dummy directory for fixtures
            lookuplists/        # A dummy directory for reference data

        mynewapp/               # The actual python package for your application
             __init__.py
            models.py           # Data models for your application
            settings.py         # Helpfully tweaked Django settings
            tests.py            # Dummy unittests
            urls.py             # Django Urlconf
            wsgi.py

            patient_lists.py    # these create the [lists](guides/list_views.md) for you application

            assets/             # Your static files directory
            templates/          # Your template directory
            migrations/         # Your Database migrations directory

            opal.sqlite         # The Sqlite development database


### Test it out

The scaffolding step has generated you a working project - so let's check that out

```bash
cd mynewapp
python manage.py runserver
```

If you now visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser, you should see the standard login screen:

<img src="/img/tutorial-login.png" style="margin: 12px auto; border: 1px solid black;"/>

The scaffolding step created you a superuser, so try logging in with the credentials:

* Username: _super_
* Password:  _super1_

When you log in you should be presented with a welcome screen that shows you the three
areas that are enabled by default - team lists, search and the admin area.

<img src="/img/tutorial-welcome.png" width="600" style="margin: 12px auto; border: 1px solid black;"/>

Opal applications are a collection of single page Angular apps that talk to the Django
server-side layer via JSON APIs. The team lists and search options here are two examples of
front-end Angular single page apps.

### Team lists

Most clinical services will need at some stage to generate a list of patients - so Opal provides
this functionality enabled by default.

The [list view](guides/list_views.md) is a spreadsheet-style list of patients - try navigating
to the list view and adding a patient with the `add patient` button. [episode](guides/datamodel.md)

<img src="/img/tutorial-list.png" width="600" style="margin: 12px auto; border: 1px solid black;"/>

Each column contains a different type of information about a patient, while each
row represents one patient.

<blockquote><small>
Strictly speaking each row is an <a href="../guides/datamodel.md">episode</a>
of care for a patient - but we'll come to that in a second.
</small></blockquote>

The columns you see initially are just a few of the standard clinical models that come with
Opal - for instance the Diagnosis model in your new application inherits from a model that
looks a lot like this:

```python
class Diagnosis(EpisodeSubrecord):
    condition         = ForeignKeyOrFreeText(Condition)
    provisional       = models.BooleanField(default=False)
    details           = models.CharField(max_length=255, blank=True)
    date_of_diagnosis = models.DateField(blank=True, null=True)

    class Meta:
        abstract = True
```

### Reference data

You will notice that the condition field has a custom field type - `ForeignKeyOrFreeText`.
This is a custom field type that we use with Opal when we want to use a
[Lookup List](guides/referencedata.md).


Lookup Lists allow us to reference canonical lists of available terminology as a foreign key, while
also allowing synonymous terms, and a free text override. That means that we can ensure that
we record high quality coded data, while allowing users an easy way to enter unusual edge
cases.

Opal has a referencedata package which is installed by default for new applications.

To see them in action, try adding a new diagnosis to your patient. As you start to type in
the condition field, you'll see that the conditions we just imported appear as suggestions:

<img src="/img/tutorial-conditions.png" style="margin: 12px auto; border: 1px solid black;"/>


<blockquote><small>
You can add your own Lookup Lists to your application. <br />
For more details consult the
<a href="../guides/referencedata/#adding-a-lookup-list">Reference Data guide</a>.
</small></blockquote>

### Add your own data models

So far we've begun to get a sense of the batteries-included parts of Opal,
but before long, you're going to need to create models for your own needs.

Most Opal models are [Subrecords](guides/datamodel.md) - they relate to either a patient, or
an episode (an episode is for example, an admission to hospital).

Let's see how that works by creating a TODO list model that is assigned to
episodes of care. In your `mynewapp/models.py` :

```
class TODOItem(models.EpisodeSubrecord):
    job       = fields.CharField(max_length=200)
    due_date  = fields.DateField(blank=True, null=True)
    details   = fields.TextField(blank=True, null=True)
    completed = fields.BooleanField(default=False)
```

This is simply a Django model, apart from the parent class `models.EpisodeSubrecord`
which provides us with some extra functionality:

* A relationship to an episode, linked to a patient
* JSON APIs for creating, retrieving and updating it
* Ensuring that the Opal Angular layer knows it exists
* Some metadata fields, like created, updated, created_by, updated_by

Next, we're going to let Opal take care of the boilerplate that we'll need to use this
model in our application. From the commandline:

```sh
python manage.py scaffold mynewapp
```

Let's take a look at what that did:

* It created a Django migration
* It ran that migration for you
* It created a detail template `mynewapp/templates/records/todo_item.html`
* It created a form template `mynewapp/templates/forms/todo_item_forml.html`

#### Detail template

The default detail template simply displays each field on a new line:

    <span ng-show="item.job">[[ item.job ]] <br /></span>
    <span ng-show="item.due_date">[[ item.due_date  | displayDate ]] <br /></span>
    <span ng-show="item.details">[[ item.details ]] <br /></span>
    <span ng-show="item.completed">[[ item.completed ]] <br /></span>

#### Form template

The default form template will display each field on a new line, with some basic
appropriate form field types set.
It uses the Opal form helpers templatetag library.

```html
{% load forms %}
{% input  field="TODOItem.job"  %}
{% datepicker  field="TODOItem.due_date"  %}
{% textarea  field="TODOItem.details"  %}
{% checkbox  field="TODOItem.completed"  %}
```

#### Adding TODOs to our Team Lists

Now let's add our TODO list model as a column in the Spreadsheet-like list view.

Patient Lists in Opal are subclasses of `opal.core.patient_lists.PatientList`, and
they live in `patient_lists.py` files of our Django apps.

<blockquote><small>
Technically these can live anywhere you like - although if you put them in other places
you're responsible for making sure that they're imported at startup.
<br />Opal guarantees
to autodiscover lists in `app.patient_list` modules.
</small></blockquote>

You can see the basic list that the Opal application scaffold created for you in
`yournewapp/patient_lists.py`.

```python
class AllPatientsList(core.patient_lists.PatientList):
    display_name = 'All Patients'

    schema = [
        models.Demographics,
        models.Diagnosis,
        models.Treatment
    ]

    def get_queryset(self):
        return Episode.objects.all()
```

The columns for lists are set in the `schema` property of the PatientList class. To add
our TODO model to the list, just add the model to the schema:

```python
    schema = [
        models.Demographics,
        models.Diagnosis,
        models.Treatment,
        models.TODOItem
    ]
```

Refresh the lists page in your browser, and you'll see your new column on the end - add a
TODO item, noting how we automatically get appropriate form types like datepickers and
checkboxes.

You can edit any entry in the list view by double clicking on it.

### Tweaking the default scaffolding

The scaffolding templates are only really supposed to get you started - you'll often
need to tweak the templates they generate with whatever logic makes sense for your
application.

#### Set an Icon for your model

You'll notice that your new column is the only one without an icon - we set the icon by
adding the following property to your `TODOItem` class:

        _icon = 'fa fa-th-list'

### Some other batteries included

Let's take a look at some of the other core functionality that we now have out of the box:

#### Search

By default, we also enable the search module, which allows you to search by patient name
or unique identifier:

<img src="/img/search.png" style="margin: 12px auto; border: 1px solid black;"/>

#### Detail views

We also have a detail view for our patients, which you can access via search results. This
view will typically allow for a more detailed display and editing of all the events
comprising a patient's care than is available on the list page.

<img src="/img/detail_1.png" style="margin: 12px auto; border: 1px solid black; width: 600px;"/>


#### JSON APIs

Opal automatically creates self-documenting JSON APIs for your interacting with the data
in your application. You can inspect these APIs interactively at the url:

    http://localhost:8000/api/v0.1/


<img src="/img/tutorial-api.png" style="margin: 12px auto; border: 1px solid black;"/>

### What next?

This is just a glimpse at the full range of functionality that comes with Opal - there is
much more to discover in the [Topic Guides](guides/topic-guides.md).
