## Installing Opal

Installation should be simple.

### Step 1: The Prerequisites

Before you install Opal, you'll need to make sure that you have
[Python](https://www.python.org/) and [pip](http://pip.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installing.html)
installed on your system.

Let's just check that you do:

    $ python --version
    Python 3.7.2
    $ pip --version
    pip 19.0.3

### Step 2: Use Pip

Now we can install Opal using pip:

    $ pip install opal

You should now have the `opal` commandline tools installed.

Let's just check that you do:

    $ opal --version
    Opal {{ config.extra.version }}

### Step 3: There is no step 3.

Maybe make yourself some tea & then try the [Tutorial](tutorial.md) instead ?
