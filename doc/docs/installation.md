## Installing OPAL

Installation should be simple.

### Step 1: The Prerequisites

Before you install OPAL, you'll need to make sure that you have 
[Python](https://www.python.org/) and [pip](http://pip.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installing.html)
installed on your system.

Let's just check that you do:

    $ python --version
    Python 2.7.5
    $ pip --version
    pip 1.5.6

### Step 2: Use Pip

Now we can install OPAL using pip:

    $ pip install opal

You should now have the `opal` commandline tools installed.

Let's just check that you do:

    $ opal --version
    OPAL 0.6.0

### Step 3: There is no step 3.

Maybe make yourself somme tea & then try the [Tutorial](tutorial.md) instead ?
