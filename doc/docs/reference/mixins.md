## Opal mixins

### SerialisableFields

if we have an allergy model with a field drug
it might serialise like below

    Allergy._get_fieldnames_to_serialize() -> ["id", "drug"]


#### build_schema_for_field_name

#### get_human_readable_type

Date & Time for a DateTime Field.

#### get_lookup_list_api_name

### ToDictMixin
Provides a method that serialises a model
to a dictionary for example
if we have an allergy model with a field drug
it might serialise like below

    allergy.to_dict() -> {"id": 1, "drug": "penicillin"}


### UpdateFromDict
Provides a method that updates a model
based on a dictionary of fields, for example

For example on a new allergy
