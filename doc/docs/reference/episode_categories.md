## opal.core.episodes


## EpisodeCategory

Opal Episodes have an associated category. These categories are implemented as subclasses
of `opal.core.episodes.EpisodeCategory`. This class is an Opal [DiscoverableFeature](../guides/discoverable.md)
and thus inherits all of the core Discoverable API.

The category of any episode can be accessed as the `.category` property of any `Episode` instance.

### Properties

## InpatientEpisode
