Opal Episode categories

An episode of care in OPAL can be one of many things:

An inpatient admission
A course of outpatient treatment
A visit to a drop in clinic
A liaison service performed for a patient (possibly across multiple episodes)
A research study enrollment

(Non exhaustive list)

An Episode category has various properties it can use to customise the way
episodes of it's category behave in OPAL applications - for instance:

Display
Permissions
Flow

By registering episode category, plugins and applications can achieve a huge
degree of flexibility over the behaviour of their episodes.
