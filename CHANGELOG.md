### 0.7.0 (Major Release)

** Episode Categories**

Refactors EpisodeCategory to be a discoverable feature.

Renames `Episode.category` -> `Episode.category_name`.

** Episode JSON API**

The Restful Episode JSON API previously available at `/episode/:pk/` is now moved into
`/api/v0.1/episode/:pk/` for consistency with the rest of our JSON APIs.
The OPAL Angular layer has been updated to reflect this, and
should handle the transition seamlessly, but code calling the API directly should update
to reflect the new URL.

** Defaults for records on the client side**

Establishes a new way to define defaults for records initialized in Javascript without
requiring that we hard-code API names to defaults in a global namespace.

*** Update to AddEpisode Signature ***

AddEpisodeCtrl now no longer requires options as a resolves() option, but requires Referencedata
instead.

** Additional utilities

Adds a datetimepicker templatetag that will render widgets for a Datetime field including time.

Updates dependency graph:

* Django -> 1.8.13

### 0.6.0 (Major Release)


**Detail views**

Moves from episode oriented detail to patient oriented detail.
(All episodes plus x-episode views are available from a patient detail screen)

**Tagging**

As a performance optimisation for the frequent access of historic tags, untagging
an episode simply renders the tag inactive rather than deleting it and relying on
Django-Reversion for access to historical data.

**Date Formatting**

We now expect 'd/m/y' date formatting by default.

**Patient lists**

Lists are now declarative, and separate from teams. They are implemented as
subclasses of opal.core.patient_lists.PatientList.

**Forms vs. Modals**

Introduces a distinction between a form and a modal.
By default, we now use forms for subrecords, only overriding the modal if there
is something we want to do differently specifically in the modal.

**Command line tools**

Adds $opal checkout for switching between applications or application versions.

### Models ContextProcessor

The 'opal.context_processors.models' Context Processor will allow you to access your
subrecords from templates without having to explicitly load them in a view. In turn,
this allows patterns like:

    {% include models.Demographics.get_detail_template %}


#### Upgrade instructions:

Full upgrade instructions to work through any backwards incompatible changes are
provided in the OPAL docs.

created_by, updated_by, created, updated
