### 0.6.0 (Major Release)


#### Detail views

Moves from episode oriented detail to patient oriented detail.
(All episodes plus x-episode views are available from a patient detail screen)

#### Tagging

As a performance optimisation for the frequent access of historic tags, untagging
an episode simply renders the tag inactive rather than deleting it and relying on
Django-Reversion for access to historical data.

#### Date Formatting

We now expect 'd/m/y' date formatting by default.

#### Patient lists

Lists are now declarative, and separate from teams. They are implemented as 
subclasses of opal.core.patient_lists.PatientList.

#### Forms vs. Modals

Introduces a distinction between a form and a modal.
By default, we now use forms for subrecords, only overriding the modal if there
is something we want to do differently specifically in the modal.

#### Command line tools

Adds $opal checkout for switching between applications or application versions.

#### Upgrade instructions:

* Update your settings to use the new date formats.

#### Analytics

Moves Analytics integration into OPAL core with the ability to blacklist pages that should never be reported

#### List view

Removed old spreadsheet-style cell based navigation and moved to row-wise nav with clearer highlighting of the active row.

created_by, updated_by, created, updated
